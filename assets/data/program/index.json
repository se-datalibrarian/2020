But without established procedures for data management, there is growing concern that data is confined in silos and disappears when the researcher moves on, forcing their successors to start from scratch. As CRS’s first Data Librarian, I will describe my process of gathering input from data stakeholders all across CRS, identifying and prioritizing requirements for data management, and formulating an action plan for data management and data services at CRS. This plan outlines actions to help researchers get the data and tools they need, provide and advocate for data stewardship, and foster homegrown communities of practice. The plan aims to address issues raised by researchers about their data workflows and pain points. In addition, it advances ongoing institutional initiatives in knowledge management and sharing, leading to better succession planning and time saved for researchers."}},{"node":{"id":"43273471","day":"Thurs, Oct 8","session":"t2_thurs","lengthMin":"20","startTimeEDT":"11:35 AM","endTimeEDT":"11:55 AM","type":"Short Talks","title":"Data Literacy Competencies for Undergraduates: Exploring Faculty Perspectives and Librarian Liaison Opportunities","presenters":"Theresa Burress (University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus), Emily Mann (University of South Florida), Rachel Walton (Rollins College), Susan Montgomery (Rollins College)","abstract":"Data literacy has joined information literacy as a core competency for undergraduate students across disciplines.

At the same time, there is little formal interaction among these actors. In particular, data librarians are rarely in direct touch with IRBs, especially ones beyond their campus, and may not be aware of evolving views among IRB professionals at large on data-sharing practices, especially those for sensitive data.\r\n \r\nThis presentation will clarify the existing nexus between IRB protocols researchers are required to file for human participant research and their data management plans, especially with respect to post-project data sharing. We will also summarize some results of an NSF-funded research project that investigates the interaction between best practices for ethically and legally sharing sensitive data and actual IRB positions on the topic. Lastly, we will share model guidance for data management plans and consent scripts that address sharing human participant data in different scenarios, which data librarians can employ in their ongoing efforts to educate their researcher community on working with sensitive data in a holistic manner."}},{"node":{"id":"f49390a4","day":"Thurs, Oct 8","session":"t2_thurs","lengthMin":"20","startTimeEDT":"11:55 AM","endTimeEDT":"12:15 PM","type":"Short Talks","title":"Data literacy in 60 minutes: teaching data literacy without a data background","presenters":"Nancy Lovas (UNC Chapel Hill)","abstract":"Data literacy is a top skill valued by employers, and universities place increasing emphasis on students' data skills in the curriculum.

Literature on RDS for college faculty at research-intensive institutions suggests that faculty find research data management services and instruction in data curation to be useful components of academic library offerings. A faculty survey at Carnegie Mellon (Van Tuyl et al., 2015) provided baseline data for developing a set of research data management services at the library. There has been less research on how faculty at liberal arts colleges navigate requirements for data management, curation, and preservation. Scaramozzino et al. (2012) examined faculty data curation behaviors and attitudes at a teaching-centered university to learn more about how faculty engaged in “small data” activities tend to manage research information. They found that faculty tended to be self-directed in their data curation workflows but were interested in collaborating with college librarians around stewardship issues. My research project explores how faculty at an R2 institution with a strong teacher-scholar model and emerging support for the scholarly communication lifecycle navigate activities related to data curation, including identifying, re-using, and preserving datasets. The research focuses on pre-tenure faculty as they tend to have less overall experience with the scholarly publishing cycle and developments in research data curation.
